# Optimizing EV Charging Infrastructure in California

This project addresses Californiaâ€™s need for expanded EV charging infrastructure using a **two-stage optimization model**:  
1. **Stage 1**: Determines the optimal number of chargers per county to reduce congestion and meet demand within budget constraints, ensuring equitable access.  
2. **Stage 2**: Evaluate energy use and unmet demand under various scenarios to validate operational efficiency and grid reliability.

## Repository Structure

### Code  
- `Best_Model.ipynb`: This is the only file that needs to be run. It includes our best models and final outputs, along with the maps.
- `Simulation_Congestion.ipynb`: This includes the python script to generate the final output file used in Best_Model. We have included the output so the file doesn't need to be run again. 
- `Extra.ipynb`: Additional scripts and models that we tried.  

### Data  
- `EV_Chargers_Last_updated_08-26-2024_ada (1).xlsx`: Data for EV chargers by county
- `ev-zipcode-demographics.xlsx`: EV ownership data by zipcode
- `table-data.csv`: Population density data by county
- `zip_code_database.csv`: Additional information by zipcode
- `zip_county.xlsx`: Additional file to combine zip and county data
- `ev_charging_congestion.csv`: File generated by running Simulation_Congestion.ipynb and used to run Best_Model.ipynb
