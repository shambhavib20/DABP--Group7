# Optimizing EV Charging Infrastructure in California

This project addresses Californiaâ€™s need for expanded EV charging infrastructure using a **two-stage optimization model**:  
1. **Stage 1**: Determines the optimal number of chargers per county to reduce congestion and meet demand within budget constraints, ensuring equitable access.  
2. **Stage 2**: Evaluates energy use and unmet demand under various scenarios to validate operational efficiency and grid reliability.
